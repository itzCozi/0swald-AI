# English-IXL-AI
IXL and delta-math are terrible learning tools so I made this POC to show my unique problem solving with coding AI apps. I heavily encorage using this to cheat your IXL's or delta-math they are bad tools instead spend time coding or any other thing that makes you happy.

## Requirments
- Pytesseract
- tkinter
- openAI (API-KEY and package)
- pyscreenshot
- PIL
- requests

## Usage
If you would like to test/run the code you will first need to...  
[License](ignore/LICENSE) | [git-ignore](ignore/LICENSE)  

1. Change pytessteract path in both 0swald.py files
2. Have all requirments installed
3. Change API-KEY to your key

To run the program simply do the following...

1. download and cd to the code (Where 0swald.py is)
2. type 'python AI.py' in your terminal
3. you should see the GUI where you can press 'p' to screenshot
