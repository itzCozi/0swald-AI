# English-IXL-AI

IXL is terrible so I made this POC to show my unique problem solving with coding AI's 

## Requirments
- Pytesseract
- tkinter
- openAI (API-KEY and package)
- pyscreenshot
- PIL
- colorama

## Usage
If you would like to test/run the code you will first need to...

1. Change pytessteract path in AI.py
2. Have all requirments installed
3. Change API-KEY to your key

To run the program simply do the following...

1. download and cd to the code (Where AI.py is)
2. type 'python AI.py' in your terminal
3. you should see the GUI where you can press 'p' to screenshot
